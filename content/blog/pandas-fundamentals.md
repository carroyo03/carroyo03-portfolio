# Getting Started with Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame, which make it easy to work with structured data.

## Prerequisites
Before you start using Pandas, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You should also have a basic understanding of Python programming concepts such as variables, loops, and functions. List comprehensions and dictionary operations are particularly useful when working with Pandas, so it is highly recommended to know them before.

## Installation
To install Pandas, you can use pip:
```
pip install pandas
```
## Basic Usage
To get started with Pandas, you first need to import it:
```python
import pandas as pd
```
## Creating a DataFrame
You can create a DataFrame from a dictionary:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## Displaying the DataFrame
```python
print(df) # If you are using Jupyter Notebook, 
          # it is better to use display(df)
```
